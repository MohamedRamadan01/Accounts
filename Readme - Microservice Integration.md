# Accounts Microservice API

This repository contains the implementation of the Accounts project, 
following the Clean Code Architecture and utilizing .NET 6. 
The project is designed to handle account-related operations, providing a reliable and scalable solution.

## Project Structure

The solution is organized into the following projects:

- `Accounts.Api`: The entry point for the microservice, responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate application logic.
- `Accounts.Application`: Contains the business logic and use cases of the microservice. This layer orchestrates data flow and business rules.
- `Accounts.Core`: Defines the core domain models, entities, and interfaces that represent the fundamental concepts of the Accounts microservice.
- `Accounts.Infrastructure`: Implements the data access layer, including repositories and unit of work using Entity Framework Core to interact with the Microsoft Access database.
- `Accounts.UnitTest`: Contains unit tests for testing various components of the microservice.

## Integrating with Microservices Architecture

The Accounts project can be seamlessly integrated into a larger microservices architecture to provide account-related functionalities. Here's how it can fit into the overall architecture:

### Communication

The microservice communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs. It can use asynchronous messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for event-driven communication or RESTful APIs for synchronous interactions.

### Authentication and Authorization

Utilize a centralized authentication and authorization service (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) to secure the microservice's endpoints and ensure that only authorized microservices can access account data.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Implement event-driven patterns to communicate state changes to other microservices. For instance, when a new account is created, an event can be emitted and consumed by other microservices interested in this event (e.g., Notifications, Analytics).

### Reusability

Promote reusability by exposing well-designed APIs that other microservices can consume. Extract common functionalities into shared libraries or packages that can be used across multiple microservices.

### Data Consistency

Implement eventual consistency strategies when interacting with other microservices. Ensure that data is eventually synchronized across microservices, even if there's a temporary inconsistency.

## Deployment

For deploying the Accounts microservice in a microservices architecture:

1. Containerize the microservice using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.
2. Utilize container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for managing and scaling microservices.
3. Configure environment-specific settings using environment variables or configuration files.

## Conclusion

The Accounts project follows Clean Code Architecture, providing a clear separation of concerns and promoting maintainability. By integrating it into a microservices architecture, you can create a flexible and scalable system where each microservice focuses on specific functionalities while collaborating seamlessly with others.
